<h1>How the AXFR protocol works</h1>
I wrote this page to explain exactly how the AXFR protocol works,
so that AXFR implementors can avoid interoperability problems.
<h2>What AXFR does</h2>
AXFR is a mechanism for replicating DNS data across DNS servers.
If, for example, the <tt>yale.edu</tt> administrator has two DNS servers,
<tt>a.ns.yale.edu</tt> and <tt>b.ns.yale.edu</tt>,
he can edit the <tt>yale.edu</tt> data on <tt>a.ns.yale.edu</tt>,
and rely on AXFR to pull the same data to <tt>b.ns.yale.edu</tt>.
<p>
Note that there are
<a href=https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tcp.html#intro-axfr>much better</a>
DNS replication protocols.
It is, of course, up to the administrator
to decide on the location of his DNS servers,
the software used for those servers,
the mechanisms for replicating data among those servers, etc.;
there is no requirement that sites replicate their data with AXFR.
<p>
AXFR is also sometimes used by unauthorized third parties
who want to sneak a peek at a site's data.
Many years ago,
these peeks were practically always successful,
because almost all sites had promiscuous AXFR servers;
these days, however,
promiscuous AXFR servers are widely discouraged
and increasingly uncommon.
<p>
(From a snoop's perspective,
the difference between AXFR and normal queries
is that normal queries force the snoop to guess the relevant domain names,
while AXFR reveals the domain names for free.
The notion that DNS data is entirely public
does not match the reality of
private high-entropy domain names at many sites.)
<p>
A few DNS parent administrators
refuse to delegate names to servers
that do not provide data through AXFR to the parent computers.
This is bad practice for several reasons,
but it nevertheless occurs,
and it means that names managed by those administrators
are available only to sites that run AXFR servers.
<h2>The life cycle of an AXFR connection</h2>
An AXFR connection may appear, at first glance,
to be a typical TCP client-server connection:
the AXFR client connects to an AXFR server on TCP port 53,
sends an AXFR request,
receives an AXFR response with the requested zone data,
and closes the connection.
For example, an AXFR client on <tt>b.ns.yale.edu</tt>
connects to an AXFR server on <tt>a.ns.yale.edu</tt> port 53,
sends an AXFR request naming <tt>yale.edu</tt>,
receives all the <tt>yale.edu</tt> data,
and closes the connection.
<p>
The story is actually more complicated than this, for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>
Before sending the AXFR request,
the AXFR client usually sends a preliminary SOA request
to decide whether it wants to see the AXFR results.
This SOA request may be sent through UDP or through TCP.
<li>
TCP port 53 is
simultaneously used by normal (non-AXFR) DNS clients
requesting data that did not fit through UDP.
A non-AXFR DNS client tries all queries through UDP first;
however, if a UDP DNS server sets the ``TC'' bit in its response,
the DNS client tries the query again through TCP.
</ul>
<p>
A <b>TCP-SOA AXFR client</b>,
such as <tt>named-xfer</tt> or <tt>axfr-get</tt> or <tt>dig axfr</tt>,
actually works as follows.
It connects to an AXFR server on TCP port 53.
It may then send an SOA request and receive a response.
It may then send an AXFR request and receive an AXFR response.
It then closes the connection.
<p>
A <b>UDP-SOA AXFR client</b>,
such as the BIND 9 AXFR client,
works as follows.
It may send an SOA request to a DNS server on UDP port 53
and receive a response.
It may then connect to an AXFR server on TCP port 53 at the same IP address,
send an AXFR request,
receive an AXFR response,
and close the connection.
<p>
An AXFR server is prepared for both types of AXFR clients,
and for non-AXFR DNS clients requesting data that did not fit through UDP.
After the server accepts a connection, it
<ol>
<li>reads a 2-byte length,
<li>reads a DNS packet of that length
(which may be an AXFR request, an SOA request, or another type of request),
<li>sends a response to that request
(consisting of one or more DNS packets for AXFR requests,
or exactly one DNS packet for other requests,
with each packet preceded by a 2-byte length),
</ol>
and repeats.
Note that DNS packets are often not aligned with TCP packets:
one DNS packet can be split across several TCP packets,
several DNS packets can be combined into one TCP packet,
etc.
<p>
In theory,
the AXFR server's procedure allows a client
to send any number of AXFR requests and other requests
in a single connection.
In practice,
current clients close the connection after the first request,
except in the case of an SOA request followed by an AXFR request
from a TCP-SOA AXFR client.
Separate requests are handled in separate connections.
<h2>How the preliminary SOA request is used</h2>
An AXFR response can include a large volume of data for a zone.
To save time,
when an AXFR client already has the zone data on disk,
it generally avoids sending AXFR requests
for additional copies of the same data.
It does this by checking the serial number in the SOA response
against the serial number in the zone on disk.
The precise test depends on the software:
<ul>
<li>BIND 9 skips the AXFR request
unless the serial number in the SOA response
minus the serial number in the zone on disk,
modulo 2^32,
is between 1 and 2^31-1 inclusive.
This rule is specified in RFC 1982.
<li>BIND 8 is like BIND 9,
but does not skip the AXFR request
if the serial number in the SOA response is zero.
<li><tt>axfr-get</tt> skips the AXFR request
only if the two serial numbers are identical and nonzero.
</ul>
Clients that know beforehand that they want to do an AXFR request,
for example because they don't have any previous copies of the zone,
can skip the SOA request.
<p>
These tests are the source of the rule
``The SOA serial number must increase whenever any other data changes.''
If the zone has changed,
but the serial number in the SOA response is not increased
(by an amount between 1 and 2^31-1 inclusive, modulo 2^32),
then AXFR clients may never see the new zone data.
<p>
One of the flaws in the AXFR protocol
is that it's actually impossible for servers to follow this rule
under all circumstances.
AXFR clients will sometimes fail to pick up changes in a zone.
<p>
For example,
suppose a BIND 9 AXFR client receives a zone through AXFR,
and then checks for changes later.
Suppose that there have been between 2^31 and 2^32-1 changes
in the meantime.
Suppose
that the AXFR server uses the strategy of increasing the serial number
by exactly 1 for each change.
Result: The AXFR client will skip the AXFR request.
The AXFR client won't receive the new data.
Similar comments apply to other serial-number strategies.
<p>
Sites that do not rely on AXFR can ignore serial numbers
in favor of mechanisms that actually ensure accurate replication,
such as the cryptographically strong checksums in rsync.
<h2>Connection failures</h2>
The AXFR protocol can fail for various reasons.
For example, the TCP connection may time out or be refused.
As another example, even if a TCP connection is opened,
it could be closed immediately;
perhaps the server is dropping all connections from the client,
or does not want to devote resources to the client right now.
As yet another example,
even if an AXFR response is in progress,
the connection may suddenly be closed;
perhaps the server administrator forced the server to shut down.
<p>
AXFR clients are prepared for incomplete AXFR responses,
and throw them away if they occur.
For example, if the <tt>b.ns.yale.edu</tt> DNS server
receives only part of the <tt>yale.edu</tt> data
from the <tt>a.ns.yale.edu</tt> DNS server,
it throws that data away,
and tries again later.
<p>
Similarly,
AXFR servers are prepared for sudden connection failures.
<p>
AXFR clients and AXFR servers,
like other network programs,
impose time limits on each network operation.
For example,
<tt>axfr-get</tt> aborts its AXFR attempt
if it does not receive any network data for 60 seconds.
<h2>AXFR request format</h2>
An AXFR request is a DNS query packet.
Here are its contents:
<ol>
<li>A two-byte query ID selected by the client.
<li>Byte \000 (meaning: query, opcode 0, not authoritative, not truncated, recursion not desired).
AXFR servers can reject anything else.
<li>Byte \000 (meaning: recursion not available, no Z bits, RCODE 0).
<li>Bytes \000\001 (meaning exactly one question).
AXFR servers can reject anything else.
<li>Bytes \000\000\000\000\000\000
(meaning no answer records, no authority records,
and no additional records);
or optionally, as an extension mechanism,
something other than \000\000\000\000\000\000.
<li>The name of the requested zone, in the usual RFC 1035 domain-name format.
<li>Bytes \000\374 (meaning query type AXFR).
This distinguishes AXFR requests from non-AXFR queries.
<li>Bytes \000\001 (meaning Internet query class).
AXFR servers can reject anything else,
including the silly alternative \000\377.
In theory, AXFR could also be used to transfer zones in non-Internet classes,
but this document restricts attention to Internet servers.
<li>Optionally, as an extension mechanism,
answer records and authority records and additional records
(as counted by the six bytes mentioned above),
communicating extra information from the client to the server.
<li>Optionally, as a Microsoft extension, bytes \115 and \123
(meaning that the client accepts multiple answers per packet,
as discussed below).
</ol>
<p>
Many servers simply extract the query ID and zone name,
stop parsing bytes after the \000\374\000\001,
and ignore the possibility of extensions.
It is the responsibility of extended AXFR clients
to preserve compatibility with unextended AXFR servers.
<h2>AXFR responses</h2>
AXFR servers can respond to AXFR requests by sending
one or more DNS packets containing the requested zone data.
AXFR servers can also respond by
sending one DNS packet explicitly rejecting the AXFR request.
AXFR servers can also close connections at any time,
as discussed earlier.
<p>
An AXFR rejection can be distinguished from zone data in several ways.
For example:
<ul>
<li>Its RCODE is nonzero.
<li>It does not have an answer record.
<li>It does not have an SOA record for the requested zone.
</ul>
BIND 9 uses the RCODE test,
and the BIND company's ``AXFR clarifications''
demand that every AXFR client use the same test.
However, this is not necessary for interoperability.
<tt>axfr-get</tt> uses a different test.
<p>
Server implementations vary in their preferred methods of indicating errors.
Here are some issues for implementors to consider:
<ul>
<li>It is possible to indicate syntax errors with RCODE 1.
However, experience indicates that
client bugs leading to syntax errors also frequently lead to
extremely dangerous synchronization errors,
so it is safer to close the connection in this case.
<li>The BIND company's ``AXFR clarifications''
tell implementors to use RCODE 9 to indicate that the AXFR server
does not have the requested zone.
However, RCODE 9 is an optional extension to the DNS protocol;
DNS clients are not required to, and often do not, understand it.
<li>The BIND company's ``AXFR clarifications''
state that clients can interpret a closed connection as a policy-based refusal.
This is simply wrong.
Closed connections, just like RCODE 2 (server failure),
happen for a much wider variety of reasons.
</ul>
In its ``AXFR clarifications,''
the BIND company demands that errors be indicated by explicit packets
rather than closed connections.
This requirement is useless
(RCODE 2 is just as uninformative as a closed connection),
not necessary for interoperability
(clients have to handle closed connections anyway),
and impossible to implement.
The notion that BIND 9 never closes a connection is ludicrous.
<p>
Sometimes a server will start sending zone data successfully,
but then encounter an error (such as a disk failure)
before completing the AXFR response.
In this case, closing the connection is by far the safest strategy.
<h2>Zone contents</h2>
A zone is a series of DNS records,
starting with an SOA record for the requested name,
continuing with any number of non-SOA records,
and concluding with a repetition of exactly the same SOA record.
(RFC 1034,
which says that all of the records for the zone name are repeated,
is wrong.)
The zone data is complete when the SOA record appears again.
<p>
An AXFR server sends a zone
by sending a series of DNS packets containing all the records in the zone,
in the format shown below.
Note that an AXFR response can, and almost always does,
include more than one DNS packet,
unlike a normal DNS response.
AXFR clients parse the DNS packets to determine the end of the response.
<p>
It is the responsibility of the AXFR server
to ensure that a zone is retrieved atomically.
If the zone changes during an AXFR response,
the AXFR server must finish sending the original zone
(concluding with the original SOA with the original serial number),
or abort the transfer
(which may mean that the zone is never successfully transferred,
if changes are frequent).
<p>
Here is the format for each DNS packet:
<ol>
<li>Two bytes.
AXFR servers must repeat the client's query ID in these two bytes;
otherwise some AXFR clients reject the data.
On the other hand, AXFR clients must not check these bytes;
some AXFR servers use \000\000 instead of the client's query ID.
The BIND company's ``AXFR clarifications'' tell implementors
to check the query ID in the first packet;
this is a bad idea, and it is certainly not necessary for interoperability.
<li>Byte \204 (meaning: response, opcode 0, authoritative, not truncated, recursion not desired),
or, optionally, \205 if the client used byte \001.
<tt>named-xfer</tt> rejects responses that do not have at least bits \204.
<li>Byte \000 (meaning: recursion not available, no Z bits, RCODE 0),
or, optionally, \200.
<li>Bytes \000\000 (meaning no questions),
or \000\001 (meaning one question).
<li>Two bytes, normally \000\001, indicating the number of answer records below.
<li>Bytes \000\000 (meaning no authority records).
<li>Bytes \000\000 (meaning no additional records).
<li>If one question was indicated above:
the name of the requested zone, in the usual RFC 1035 domain-name format;
bytes \000 and \374 (meaning query type AXFR);
and bytes \000 and \001 (meaning Internet query class).
<li>Answer records in the usual RFC 1035 format.
There is always at least one answer record;
there is normally exactly one answer record.
</ol>
<p>
<tt>axfrdns</tt> never includes the question.
BIND 9 includes the question in the first packet
but not in subsequent packets.
The BIND company's ``AXFR clarifications''
tell implementors to use the BIND 9 strategy,
but this has no benefits; it is certainly not necessary for interoperability.
<p>
<tt>axfr-get</tt> reads records through the end of the packet.
BIND 9 reads only the records in the answer section.
Both of these parsing mechanisms work properly,
because the authority section and the additional section are empty.
The BIND company's ``AXFR clarifications''
demand that implementors use the BIND 9 parsing mechanism,
but this has no benefits; it is certainly not necessary for interoperability.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>
A huge number of AXFR client installations
do not support more than one answer record per packet.
Consequently, AXFR servers must send one answer record per packet.
(On the bright side, this is also the easiest strategy to implement.)
<p>
The BIND company,
demonstrating an astonishing disregard for interoperability,
changed BIND to start sending multiple answer records per packet by default,
even though they were perfectly aware that this breaks many deployed clients.
Consequently, AXFR clients must accept multiple answer records per packet.
<p>
(The BIND company's excuse, namely bandwidth,
displays an equally astonishing lack of perspective.
AXFR traffic is a tiny part of DNS traffic,
and DNS traffic is a tiny part of total web traffic.
In the unlikely event
that there's any site that actually cares about AXFR bandwidth:
You should be using gzipped rsync, not this primitive AXFR protocol.)
<h2>Repeated records in a zone</h2>
Whenever BIND 8 includes an NS record in a zone,
it immediately includes a copy of the relevant glue records,
even if this means repeating glue records.
For example, the address of <tt>a.root-servers.net</tt> is repeated
in the February 2003 root zone from <tt>b.root-servers.net</tt>:
<pre>     @ 1D IN SOA A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET NSTLD.VERISIGN-GRS.COM ...
       6D IN NS A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET
     A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET 5w6d16h IN A 198.41.0.4
     ...
     mil 1D IN NS A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET
     A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET 5w6d16h IN A 198.41.0.4
     ...
     @ 1D IN SOA A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET NSTLD.VERISIGN-GRS.COM ...
</pre>
<p>
AXFR clients remove all repeated records in zones received through AXFR.
(Note to Bert: Sorting times essentially linear time,
not quadratic time.)
<p>
The BIND company's ``AXFR clarifications''
tell AXFR servers to avoid repeating any records (other than the SOA).
However, this is not necessary for interoperability.
The BIND company's bandwidth excuse is frivolous, as discussed above.
<h2><a name=poison>Poison in a zone</a></h2>
Suppose that an ISP
is simultaneously a third-party DNS server for <tt>.edu</tt>
and a third-party DNS server for <tt>princeton.edu</tt>.
<p>
Suppose the ISP pulls the <tt>princeton.edu</tt> zone
from a Princeton AXFR server,
and receives the data
<pre>     haven.princeton.edu NS serv1.net.yale.edu
     serv1.net.yale.edu A 128.112.128.15
</pre>
from the AXFR server.
The point of the following analysis is that the ISP
<b>must</b> discard the <tt>yale.edu</tt> information.
<p>
An innocent user's cache has the legitimate record
<pre>     yale.edu NS serv1.net.yale.edu
</pre>
saved.
The user asks for the address of <tt>www.haven.princeton.edu</tt>.
The cache contacts the root server,
learns that the ISP is a <tt>.edu</tt> server,
contacts the ISP, and receives the same information
<pre>     haven.princeton.edu NS serv1.net.yale.edu
     serv1.net.yale.edu A 128.112.128.15
</pre>
that the ISP obtained from the Princeton server.
Because the ISP is a <tt>.edu</tt> server,
the cache trusts and saves the <tt>serv1.net.yale.edu</tt> information.
The user now asks for the address of <tt>www.yale.edu</tt>.
The cache knows <tt>yale.edu NS serv1.net.yale.edu</tt>
and <tt>serv1.net.yale.edu A 128.112.128.15</tt>,
so it contacts 128.112.128.15
to obtain the address of <tt>www.yale.edu</tt>.
In short, Princeton has been given control over the Yale web server.
<p>
As a general rule,
before any data can be made available
from a zone retrieved from a third party through AXFR,
records that don't end with the zone name have to be discarded.
There is no harm in
AXFR clients discarding all such records upon receipt.
<p>
When I first mentioned this type of attack,
the BIND 9 implementors claimed that it was safe
for the ISP to provide the <tt>serv1.net.yale.edu</tt> information
as glue for <tt>haven.princeton.edu</tt>.
That claim is false, as the above analysis shows.
Do some versions of BIND 9 fail to discard the poison?
Is this yet another BIND vulnerability?
<h2>Database indexing in the Domain Name System</h2>
The following discussion is important background
for understanding how clients handle parent-child discrepancies.
<p>
RFC 1034 and RFC 1035 specify the semantics of the Domain Name System:
the DNS database is a collection of trees, containing nodes,
containing record sets of various types.
There is one tree for each class (IN, CH, etc.);
at most one node in each tree for each name (aol.com, etc.);
and at most one record set in each node for each type (A, MX, etc.).
<p>
In other words,
the DNS database at any moment
is a collection of record sets,
indexed by class, name, and type.
For example, there is one record set for class IN, name aol.com, type A.
(That record set contains four IP addresses right now:
64.12.187.24, 205.188.145.213, 205.188.160.120, and 64.12.149.25.)
<p>
Of course, this semantic rule does not mean
that copies of data around the Internet
are magically equalized if they have the same class, name, and type.
Most of the copying protocols have reliability problems,
producing accidental (though usually harmless) inconsistencies.
Often people deliberately introduce inconsistencies---for example,
giving different answers to different clients.
(This is called ``client differentiation'' in tinydns,
and ``views'' in BIND 9.)
<p>
What the semantic rule means is that
implementations are allowed to store record sets
by class, name, and type.
If an implementation is faced with two record sets
of the same class, name, and type,
it is allowed to throw one record set away.
Three examples:
<ul>
<li>Consider, once again, client differentiation:
some servers store data indexed by class, name, type, and client IP address.
Everybody else is free to assume that this doesn't happen.
For example, a client that uses two IP addresses for its outgoing requests,
and receives different data under the same class+name+type
on the two IP addresses,
is under absolutely no obligation to keep track of both record sets.
<li>Consider, as a simpler example,
the fact that different servers for a zone can have different data.
Everybody else is free to assume that this doesn't happen.
(RFC 1034, section 4.3.5:
``must be distributed to all of the name servers.'')
If a client receives different record sets from the two servers,
under the same class+name+type,
it can use either one.
It is under no obligation to keep track of both record sets.
<li>Consider, as a third example,
the fact that a parent and a child can have different data
for the same class+name+type.
Everybody else is free to assume that this doesn't happen:
i.e., that the parent record set is an exact copy of the child record set.
(RFC 1034, section 4.2.1:
``exactly the same as the corresponding RRs in the ... subzone.''
Section 4.2.2: ``the NS and glue RRs
which mark both sides of the cut are consistent and remain so.'')
If a client receives different record sets from the two servers,
under the same class+name+type,
it can use either one.
It is under no obligation to keep track of both record sets.
</ul>
<p>
To summarize:
The fact that one DNS implementation
indexes its database by something more than class+name+type
does not oblige other DNS implementations to do the same thing.
<h2>Handling parent-child discrepancies</h2>
Suppose an ISP's DNS server
is a third-party DNS server for <tt>princeton.edu</tt>,
and simultaneously a third-party DNS server for <tt>cs.princeton.edu</tt>.
<p>
As discussed above, the ISP is free to assume
that the <tt>princeton.edu</tt> zone
contains the same <tt>cs.princeton.edu</tt> data
as the <tt>cs.princeton.edu</tt> zone.
If the <tt>princeton.edu</tt> AXFR server says
<pre>     cs.princeton.edu NS cs.princeton.edu
     cs.princeton.edu NS engram.cs.princeton.edu
</pre>
while the <tt>cs.princeton.edu</tt> AXFR server says
<pre>     cs.princeton.edu NS dns1.cs.princeton.edu
     cs.princeton.edu NS dns2.cs.princeton.edu
</pre>
then the ISP is free to discard the first record set
in favor of the second.
If the Princeton administrators don't like this for some reason, too bad;
it's their fault for not following the DNS semantics specified in RFC 1034.
<p>
As a general rule,
when AXFR results for <tt>w.x.y.z</tt> and <tt>y.z</tt> are combined,
any record sets in the <tt>y.z</tt> zone
whose names end with <tt>w.x.y.z</tt> can be discarded.
<p>
BIND 9, unlike most DNS server installations on the Internet,
keeps track of both record sets.
Of course,
it is forced to throw one record set away when it responds to queries;
a query asks for a record set by class+name+type.
<p>
In yet another demonstration of
their astonishing disregard for interoperability,
the BIND company is pushing an optional ``IXFR'' protocol
that assumes the BIND 9 behavior.
They say that IXFR breaks horribly
when it encounters the standard RFC 1034 behavior.
Normal people conclude that IXFR is broken
and that IXFR has to be fixed.
(I've explained elsewhere how to fix it.)
But the BIND company
is instead demanding in its ``AXFR clarifications''
that most AXFR clients on the Internet be changed to accommodate IXFR.
This is insane.
<h2>The BIND 8.2.3 bug</h2>
The BIND company introduced the following rule into BIND 8.2.3:
zones are only allowed to contain
<ul>
<li>authoritative records for that zone,
<li>NS records immediately below the zone,
<li>A records that those NS records point to,
<li>AAAA records that those NS records point to, and
<li>A6 records that those NS records point to.
</ul>
For example, if the <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt> zone
contains a record for <tt>full.moon.heaven.af.mil</tt>,
BIND 8.2.3 might reject the entire zone,
depending on exactly what the record types and contents are.
<p>
BIND 8.2.3 applies this rule
not only to zones added manually by the system administrator,
but also to data received through AXFR,
so it creates interoperability problems.
<p>
There are many ways to see that the BIND 8.2.3 rule is flawed.
Here's the easiest:
What happens if the IETF adds another address type beyond A/AAAA/A6?
Answer: a zone administrator who adds a record of that type
causes a complete zone-transfer failure with BIND 8.2.3.
This is even worse than
<a href=https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/newtypes.html>BIND's other problems with new types</a>,
because it kills the whole zone transfer,
not just the new records.
<p>
As a general rule,
AXFR clients cannot assume that they will be able to figure out
why a record was included in a zone.
<p>
Zone creators probably don't need to worry about the BIND 8.2.3 bug.
Subsequent versions of BIND (including BIND 9)
have reportedly been fixed;
and all BIND 8.2.3 users are required to upgrade,
